# Companies running on Functional Programming Paradigm - Where to begin your search for FP jobs
This is a list of companies that use a Functional Programming Language for their core product(s) or services.  

#### Qualifiers (albeit somewhat subjective):  
- Core product, or major services run on Functional Programming Paradigm   
- Company is known by many technologist and/or consumers  
- Company has many FP jobs online or has many FP developers on LinkedIn  

#### Contribute:
- Make an issue for companies that you believe are erroneously listed, with description of why you believe that  
- Turn list items into hyperlinked items to the companies career page
- Pull Request a new company or language to be added
- Make an issue for a new company or language to be added
- Make an issue if you think a particular company should be moved up or down its respective language list

## By Lang
- Each lang list ordered by how well known the company is, measured by Market Cap (public), User Count (if it exists). If neither measure is available, start an Issue for the company and allow others to vote on where it should fall on the list.  
- The simple definition to qualify as Functional for this list is first class function and core lang minimizes side effects. If this bothers you, feel free to explain yourself in an issue:)
